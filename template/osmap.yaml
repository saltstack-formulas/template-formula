# Setup variables using grains['os'] based logic.
# You just need to add the key:values for an `os` that differ
# from `defaults.yaml` + `os_family.yaml`.
# Only add an `os` which is/will be supported by the formula
#
# If you do not need to provide defaults via the `os` grain,
# you will need to provide at least an empty dict in this file, e.g.
# osmap: {}
